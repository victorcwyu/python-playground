# code introspection is the ability to examine classes, functions, and
# keywords to know what they are, what they do and what they know

# Python provides several functions and utilities for code introspection
# help()
# dir()
# hasattr()
# id()
# type()
# repr()
# callable()
# issubclass()
# isinstance()
# __doc__
# __name__

# exercise: print a list of all attributes of the given Vehicle object
# Use the help function to see what each function does.
# Delete this when you are done.
help(dir)
help(hasattr)
help(id)

# Define the Vehicle class.
class Vehicle:
    name = ""
    kind = "car"
    color = ""
    value = 100.00
    def description(self):
        desc_str = "%s is a %s %s worth $%.2f." % (self.name, self.color, self.kind, self.value)
        return desc_str

# Print a list of all attributes of the Vehicle class.
# Your code goes here
print(dir(Vehicle))
